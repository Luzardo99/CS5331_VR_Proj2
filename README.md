# Urban Planning VR Game

Demo: https://youtu.be/D6ts7y-ZUHA 

We plan on creating a transformative urban planning VR game that allows the user to try their hand at city building. The user will be able to place buildings wherever they see fit and depending on these locations the game will give them a score based on how efficient their system is. Players will have the ability to create any city area they desire as we have a large catalog of city infrastructure and buildings to work with. The game will feature three varying modes ranging from easy to hard. Easy mode will consist of abundant resources while hard modes will have you thinking how to use your limited sources.

# Game Scoring


  -Player starts at 100
  
  -Point are reduced at the end
  
  -Based on efficiency of city so no unneeded infrastructure
  
  -Houses should be together and no house should be separated
  
  -Businesses should be within reasonable distance to group of homes
  
  -No structure should have be put without a road to access it
